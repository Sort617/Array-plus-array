- `tests.py`: Includes tests for `array_plus_array` using various input arrays.

**Functionality:**
- `array_plus_array(arr1, arr2)`: Merges `arr2` into `arr1` and calculates the total sum of all elements in the merged array.

**Usage:**
1. Import the function from `solution.py`.
2. Call `array_plus_array` with two arrays as arguments.

**Tests:**
- The function is tested with positive, negative, and mixed numbers to ensure accuracy.
- Each test compares the function's output to the expected sum.

Ensure Python is installed to run the files.
